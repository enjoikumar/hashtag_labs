## 4. What is ajax? Describe a situation where it is useful.
### AJAX is the method of exchanging data with a server, and updating parts of a web page without reloading the entire page. For example making callbacks, which is retrieving or saving data, making asynchronous calls, being user-friendly, and having increased speed. A situation where AJAX is useful is Netflix. By using AJAX calls, when hovering over a movie, the user is shown the overall movie rating and can input their own rating without having to reload the page. It creates more user friendly interfaces and speeds up requests.
