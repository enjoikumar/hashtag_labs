## 1. What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS? 
### The difference between HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTP) is that http computers agree on the code given, often times scrambling messages and encyrpting data to keep users safe from hackers. HTTPS is more secure than HTTP because HTTPS creates an encrypted connection through the usel of SSL certificates.


## 2. What is the difference between HTTP GET and POST?
### HTTP POST requests get additial data from the client server, while the GET requests already have all the data which is inscribed in the URL. A GET request is sending a request to a server 'requesting' information. A POST request is when you are sending data to a server. An example of GET would be getting your weather, and a POST example would be posting a facebook update. 


## 3. What is the difference between the HTTP 2xx status codes and 4xx status codes?
### The HTTP 2xx status codes are success codes from the server and HTTP 4xx status codes are client error codes from the server. HTTP 2xx success codes can include OK, created, accepted, no content, reset content, partial content, and multi status. While the HTTP 4xx status codes can include Bad request, unauthorized, Forbidden, not found, method not allowed, Not acceptable, and Request time-out. 


## 4. What is ajax? Describe a situation where it is useful.
### AJAX is the method of exchanging data with a server, and updating parts of a web page without reloading the entire page. For example making callbacks, which is retrieving or saving data, making asynchronous calls, being user-friendly, and having increased speed. A situation where AJAX is useful is Netflix. By using AJAX calls, when hovering over a movie, the user is shown the overall movie rating and can input their own rating without having to reload the page. It creates more user friendly interfaces and speeds up requests. 


## 5. What is responsive design?
### Responsive design is the approach that the design and development should respond to the user's screen size, platform, and orientation. For example making web pages fit to screen regardless of screen size, or making a site mobile responsive to fit the screen size of the user's cellphone. 


## 6. What is the difference between these 3 CSS rules?
`div {background:#fff;} #div {background:#fff;} .div {background:#fff;}##`

### div{background:#fff;} means that every div will have the background be #fff. 
#div {background:#fff;} means that every element with an id of div will have the background become #fff. 
.div {background:#fff} means that every element with a class of div will have the background become #fff 

## 7. What is the difference between these 2 uses of the <script> tag?
<script src=”http://example.com/whatever.js”></script> <script>var whatever = true</script>
### The first <script src"http...." > </script> means that its linked to an html site, and the second </script> <script>var whatever = true</script> means tits inline scripting where you can write javascript 


## 8. What is the difference between these two javascript snippets?

`var x = function() { return 1+1;
}();

var y = function() { return 1+1;
};`

### x is a function where you can write x and get the answer, whileas for the y function it would need to be written as `y();` to get the answer

b. One blue box, 200x200 pixels

d. The green box should be centered inside the red box
